🚀 First Step for my Web Development journey!

🛠️ What I Learned:

 
  -DOM manipulation
  
  -JavaScript functions and event handling
  
  -Game logic using arrays and conditions
  
  -Dynamic UI updates
  
  -Score tracking and game state management

💡 This was a fun way to apply the core concepts of JavaScript and improve my understanding of front-end development. It’s simple, but it’s a big step forward for me in my web development journey!

🌱 I’m just getting started — more projects coming soon.
